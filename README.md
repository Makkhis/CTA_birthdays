## Introduction

On this project, we have a .php archive that sends an email to 
any whose birthday matches the current day and month, to run it 
a script will need to be used.


## Installation

We use phpdotenv and phpmailer, and all of them will be installed in the same folder

- **composer instalation** 

use the following comands

```bash
composer require vlucas/phpdotenv
```

This comand will add diferent folders, one of which is called vlucas/phpdotenv

After that we will use a similar comand

```bash
composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
```

those are the two library that we will use
